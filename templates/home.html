    <p>and after night dark days innumerable <br>
        broke forth and shattered against stone <br>
        and shadows fled like ripples before the wind</p> 
    <p>a creek rolls low over watersmooth stones <br>
        through hills and willows<br>
        and gives way to the earth<br>
        carrying the length of longing</p>
    <p>deep between the trees and even to the sea</p>
